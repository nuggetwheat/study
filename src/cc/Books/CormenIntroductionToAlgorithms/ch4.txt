What does FIND-MAXIMUM-SUBARRAY return when all elements of A are negative?

It returns a range containing a single element that is the largest negative number

=== 4.1-2

Write pseudocode for the brute-force method of solving the maximum-subarray
problem.  Your procedure should run in THETA-n^2 time.

FIND-MAXIMUM-SUBARRAY (A, low, high)
  best_sum = 0
  best_low = low
  best_high = low
  for i = low to high-1
    sum = 0
    for j = i to high
      sum += A[j]
      if sum > best_sum
        best_sum = sum
        best_low = i
        best_high = j
  return (best_low, best_high, best_sum);

It jumps around a bit from run to run.  For example here is the crossover points
from seven consecutive runs:

33 35 59 23 24 27 34

=== 4.1-5
