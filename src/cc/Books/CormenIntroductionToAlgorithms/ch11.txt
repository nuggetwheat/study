=== 11.1-1

Given a dynamic set S represented by a direct-address table T of length m,
describe a procedure that finds the maximum element of S.  What is the
worst-case performance?

Start from the end of the direct-address array and walk backwards until you find
a non-empty slot.  Worst case performance is O(n) if the table is empty.

=== 11.1-2

Describe how to use a bit vector to represent a dynamic set of distinct elements
with no satellite data.

If the keys of the set can be represented as integers in a small contiguous
range, then each key can be by an offset in the bit vector.  To insert an item,
set the bit corresponding to the offset defined by the key.  To search for an
item is in the set, test the bit corresponding to the offset defined by the key.
To delete an item, clear the bit correstponding to the offset defined by the
key.

=== 4.1-3

It jumps around a bit from run to run.  For example here is the crossover points
from seven consecutive runs:

33 35 59 23 24 27 34
