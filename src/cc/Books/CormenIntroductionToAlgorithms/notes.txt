Matrix Chain Multiplication

Given matrices a, b, c, and d

For each matrix m, there are two association choices:
1. It associates with something to it's right (m
2. It associates with something to it's left m)

The first matrix only associates to the right, the last matrix only associates
to the left.  So for the four matrices a, b, c, and d we have the following
four possibilities:

(a * (b * (c * d)
(a * (b * c) * d)
(a * b) * (c * d)
(a * b) * c) * d)

Since each possible matrix (except the first and the last) has two choices, the
total number of associations can be expressed as:

2^(n-2) == (2^n)*(2^-2) == (2^n)*(1/4)
